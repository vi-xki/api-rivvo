// This script was used for Prisma checks and has been removed because Prisma was replaced with TypeORM.
// If you need a quick check script, consider creating a TypeORM script that connects to the SQLite DB (dev.db) and queries users.

console.log('checkUser.js removed — use a TypeORM-based script if needed.');
